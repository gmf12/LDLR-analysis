# LDLR-analysis
LDLR + membrane simularions
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess the influence of LDLR missense variants on protein conformational changes and intra-molecular interactions during MD simulations. PCA results are shown as a conformer plot with two main components (PC1 and PC2), states (clustered conformational structures), and motions (trajectory variability). Briefly, PCA generated by backbone whole protein of LDLR, and each MD frame were extracted and aligned using scripts (trj_selection_dl.py and trj_align.py) from Schrodinger package 2021v.2. Individual simulations from all runs were merged using the “trj_merge.py script” into a final trajectory and a CMS file, which was further used to generate the principal components. Principal components of protein backbone atoms were calculated using the “trj_essential_dynamics.py script”. PCA conformer plots were generated using the Python language, available in the GitHub repository (code: XXXX). All commands were built using JuPyter language and libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, and Pandas).
